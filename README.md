## Introduction

The Microsphere BOM project provides a centralized Bill of Materials (BOM) of third-party libraries for the Microsphere
ecosystem. Its primary purpose is to manage and harmonize dependency versions across multiple projects, ensuring
compatibility and reducing configuration overhead for developers.

By importing this BOM, downstream projects can declare dependencies without specifying version numbers, relying instead
on the curated set of versions maintained within this repository. This project is built upon the [
`microsphere-build`](https://github.com/microsphere-projects/microsphere-build) parent project

### Language Support

Microsphere Build supports the Maven project building on Java TLS versions:

- 8
- 11
- 17
- 21
- 25

            <artifactId>microsphere-all-bom</artifactId>
            <version>${microsphere-bom.version}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
